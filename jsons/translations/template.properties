Long life and salutations to you, Prince Arung Palakka, liberator of Bone and hero to the Buginese people. It was your courageous effort in the 1660 rebellion against Gowa-Tallo dominion that led Bone to freedom, culminating in the Makassar War. By cooperating with the VOC, you succeeded in making Bone the sole ruler of South Sulawesi. Some may consider you a traitor, a hypocrite, and an authoritarian and ruthless leader.

The mountains come to life at the sound of your name, Aliguyon, mighty warrior and chief of the Igorot people! The Igorot have inhabited the mountains of the northern Philippines for thousands of years. Since then, they have become undisputed masters of the mountains, coaxing from the hard rock thriving towns and villages, as well as rice terraces admired by the world over. Your legend, brave Aliguyon, lives on in these people's hearts and their songs. Even now, tales of your valor against the formidable chief Pumbakhayon reach further across the land. = 
 # Requires translation!
O' Aliguyon, the Igorot people leave the mountains' embrace in search of alien lands, and the terraces lie ruined by neglect. Can you seize the reins of leadership and prove the legends true? Can you establish a people at one with nature and their fellow man? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

Stand proud, Azim Ud-Din I, the first of his name, sovereign ruler of the Sultanate of Sulu!

Under your rule, the Sultanate of Sulu emerged as a maritime power, commanding trade routes and fostering cultural exchange in the Sulu Archipelago. Notorious for its so-called 'Moro Raids' or acts of piracy directed toward Spanish settlements, the sultanate managed to thwart Spanish attempts to subjugate the Moro people for centuries. =
